\section{Research Conducted}
\subsection{Primary Research}
For all intents and purposes, the primary research for my project has
already been conducted.  As I said in the proposal, I spent last summer
learning and implementing the Transcendental Risch Algorithm for
Symbolic Integration. Because I was implementing the algorithm, I had to
fully understand it, both from a mathematical and a implementational
perspective.  Therefore, I have read quite closely almost the entirety
of Bronstein's book \cite{bronstein2005symbolic}.  In other words, this was
more than just a cursory reading.  In order to implement an algorithm,
you have to understand exactly what is happening mathematically, so that
you can fix problems when they arrise.  Also, sometimes the algorithms
given were ambiguous, requiring me to understand what should be
happening enough to implement it, because actual implementations in
programming languages cannot be ambiguous in any way, by their nature.
