\section{Research}
\subsection{Primary Research}
As I said in the first progress report, I have already completed all of
my primary research, as I did this over the last summer.  As I said
there, I have read almost the entirety of Bronstein's book
\cite{bronstein2005symbolic}, and have used the information contained to
implement most of the algorithm in Sym\-Py.

\subsection{Secondary Research}
I think that I will not need any further secondary sources from the ones
that I reviewed in the first progress report
\cite{bronstein1989simplification, davenport1984integration,
kauers2008integration, moses1971symbolic, risch1969problem}.  In
addition to these, I have two other papers, which I mentioned in the
proposal but did not review in the first progress report
\cite{roach1997meijerg, adamchik1990hypergeometric}.  I did not include
these two because the assignment only called for five sources, but these
would fall under the category of additional work sources that I
mentioned.

The reason that I feel that these are sufficient is that the majority of
the paper will focus on my work implementing the algorithm from
Bronstein's book.  The only places where I will need these secondary
sources is in the part of the paper where I go over the history of the
algorithm and the end, where I look at possible future work.  These both
will be relatively short parts of the paper.
