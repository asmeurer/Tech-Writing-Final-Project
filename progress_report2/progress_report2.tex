\section{Research}
\subsection{Primary Research}
As I said in the first progress report, I have already completed all of
my primary research, as I did this over the last summer.  As I said
there, I have read almost the entirety of Bronstein's book \cite{bronstein2005symbolic}, and have
used the information contained to implement most of the algorithm in
Sym\-Py.
