\emph{Details of the implementation in SymPy goes here.}

Over the summer of 2010, as part of the Goo\-gle Summer of Code program, I
implemented the algorithms described in Bronstein's
book~\cite{bronstein2005symbolic} in the SymPy \gls{cas}.  As was noted
in Section \ref{description}, the algorithm is very complex. 
Bronstein's book only describes the
transcendental%\gls{transcendental}
part of the algorithm. I was able to finish the implementation of most
of this, so that the algorithm in SymPy can integrate most
transcendental functions with exponentials and logarithms, %gls
or prove that no such antiderivative exists.  

\emph{This will, among other things, include some sample sessions
demonstrating the algorithm.}
