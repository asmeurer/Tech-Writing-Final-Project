\newglossaryentry{integration}{
name={integration},
description={One of two fundamental operations in \gls{calculus} (the
other being differentiation).  Integration deals with the area under
curves.  Informally, $\int_a^b{f(x) dx}$ represents the area under the
curve defined by the function $f(x)$ from the points $x=a$ to $x=b$.  It
is an important result from \gls{calculus} called the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus that integration and \Antidifferentiation, the
inverse operation of \gls{differentiation}, are essentially the same
thing}

\newglossaryentry{calculus}{
name={calculus},
description={The branch of mathematics that studies limits, derivatives,
integrals, and infinite series.  Informally, calculus is the study of
change.  Calculus is one of the most applied branch of mathematics; it
is used in every single branch of the physical sciences}
}

\newglossaryentry{differentiation}{
name={differentiation},
description={One of two fundamental operations in \gls{calculus} (the
other being integration).  Differentiation deals with the change of
functions.  The function $\frac{df}{dx}$ is called the derivative of $f$,
and it informally represents the change, or slope, of the function $f$
at any point $x$}
