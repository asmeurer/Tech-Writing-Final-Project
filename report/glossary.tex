\newglossaryentry{integration}{
name={integration},
description={One of two fundamental operations in \gls{calculus} (the
other being differentiation).  Integration deals with the area under
curves.  Informally, $\int_a^b{f(x)\,dx}$ represents the area under the
curve defined by the function $f(x)$ from the points $x=a$ to $x=b$.  It
is an important result from \gls{calculus} called the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus that integration and \Antidifferentiation, the
inverse operation of \gls{differentiation}, are essentially the same
thing}
}

\newglossaryentry{calculus}{
name={calculus},
description={The branch of mathematics that studies limits, derivatives,
integrals, and infinite series.  Informally, calculus is the study of
change.  Calculus is one of the most applied branch of mathematics; it
is used in every single branch of the physical sciences}
}

\newglossaryentry{differentiation}{
name={differentiation},
description={One of two fundamental operations in \gls{calculus} (the
other being integration).  Differentiation deals with the change of
functions.  The function $\frac{df}{dx}$ is called the derivative of $f$,
and it informally represents the change, or slope, of the function $f$
at any point $x$}
}

\newglossaryentry{elementary}{
name={elementary},
description={Roughly speaking, a function is elementary if it can be
represented as a combination of exponentials, logarithms, powers, and
trigonometric functions by addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and composition. For example, $\frac{\sin{(x^2 +
1)}}{\sqrt[3]{\ln{x}}}$ is elementary, but
$\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int{e^{-x^2}\,dx}$, the \gls{error function}, is
not. See Bronstein's book \cite{bronstein2005symbolic}, page 133, for a
more rigorous definition}
}

\newglossaryentry{error function}{
name={error function},
description={The function defined by \[\mathrm{erf}{(x)} =
\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int{e^{-x^2}\,dx}.\]  This is the classic example
of an integral of an \gls{elementary} function that is not itself
\gls{elementary}.  The \gls{error function} is important in statistics.
In particular, it represents the cumulative distribution function of the
normal distribution (i.e., a bell curve), and its values are used to
calculate probabilities.  The fact that this function is non-elementary
implies that statistical computing packages must use numerical
techniques to calculate these values, as it does not have a closed form
solution}
