\opening{Dear Dr. Simpson:}

Please accept this report, ``Report  on the Risch Algorithm and
Implementation in the SymPy Computer Algebra System.''  This report
fulfills the report part of the final technical report requirement for
English 341, Technical Writing.

The report gives an overview of the transcendental Risch Algorithm for
symbolic integration and my implementation of it in the SymPy computer
algebra system.  The report also contains two appendices and a glossary,
which are included at the end.  There is also, of course, a list of
references at the end.  There are no additional figures or tables; any
figures in the report are placed in line with the rest of the document.
In short, the entire report is self-contained.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
